## Objective
The purpose of this workshop is to get you started working with Bluemix, Node-Red, Watson IoT, and a Raspberry Pi.  You will be defining a Raspberry Pi as an IoT device in the Watson IoT service.  Following that, you will use Node-Red to create an application on the Pi that reports sensor information (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, etc.) to another Node-Red application running on Bluemix.  Two sets of instructions are provided.  If you have prior experience and would like to try and complete the exercise on your own, follow the Jedi Master path.  Otherwise, if you prefer a more guided approach, choose the Jedi Padowan path.  Choose wisely and have fun.

### Total time to complete:  1 hour

## Prerequisites

This workshop assumes that you have completed the STSA event prerequisite activities.  Specifically, you should have:
   * An SSH terminal program for connecting to the Raspberry Pi.  If you are using a MacOS or Linux based system, you are ready to go. If using Windows, you should have installed the PuTTY application available on the IBM Standard Software installer.
